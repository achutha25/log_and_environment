This assignment focuses on preparing our Python application for a production environment by introducing environment variables, structured logging, and a continuous integration workflow. By using a .env file for secure configuration, configuring a logging.conf for standardized log output, and adding a GitHub Actions pipeline for automated testing, the project gains a more reliable and maintainable structure that aligns closely with industry best practices.
